There are also several tool the driverstation provides, like allowing you to kill your programs at anytime, and receive output from the robot.

The FRC Driverstation is a program that you run on your computer, that interfaces with the roborio over any of the connections mentioned at the end of the Hello, World example.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The FRC Driverstation only runs on Windows. You can deploy from any computer, but you will need to have a Windows computer to run the driverstation on. If you are connected over wifi, more than one computer can connect, so you don't need to switch what computer you are plugged into.
