# Introduction

To our knowledge, there is no complete guide to Java FRC programming, so we have decided to create this tutorial. The tutorial is intended for anyone with any amount of Java programming experiance. 

## This tutorial will teach the basics of FRC Java programming, along with command based programming.

Topics will include:

{% page-ref page="hello-world-example.md" %}

{% page-ref page="git-github.md" %}

{% page-ref page="driverstation.md" %}

{% page-ref page="subsytems.md" %}

{% page-ref page="motors.md" %}

{% page-ref page="commands.md" %}

{% page-ref page="joysticks.md" %}

{% page-ref page="drivetrain.md" %}

{% page-ref page="encoders.md" %}

{% page-ref page="gyros.md" %}

{% page-ref page="shuffleboard.md" %}

This book is not intended to teach basic Java concepts. However, the reality is that most poeple reading this tutorial will also be learning Java at the same time, so links refrences to videos in a free Udemy course will be provided for many of the Java concepts needed

Thank you for reading this far. Happy coding!
