# Introduction

To my knowledge, there is no complete guide to Java FRC programming, so I have decided to create this tutorial. The tutorial is intended for anyone with any amount of Java programming experiance. To get the most out of this tutorial, please prepare by getting a roborio, and other matrials to begin programming.

## This tutorial will teach the basics of FRC Java programming, along with command based programming.

Topics will include:

{% page-ref page="hello-world-example.md" %}

{% page-ref page="git-github.md" %}

{% page-ref page="dashboard.md" %}

{% page-ref page="untitled-1.md" %}

{% page-ref page="untitled-2.md" %}

{% page-ref page="commands.md" %}

{% page-ref page="joysticks.md" %}

{% page-ref page="untitled-3.md" %}

{% page-ref page="encoders.md" %}

{% page-ref page="gyros.md" %}

{% page-ref page="untitled.md" %}

{% page-ref page="imaging-the-radio.md" %}

This book is not intended to teach basic Java concepts. However, the reality is that most poeple reading this tutorial will also be learning Java at the same time, so links refrences to videos in a free Udemy course will be provided for many of the Java concepts needed

### Notes:

* This tutorial is written for the 2018 control system, however, we do plan to update this tutorial if possible.
* While this tutorial is written by and for Team 1732, other teams may find it useful. Be aware that some items are specific to Team 1732, but I will try to include a warning.
* Team 1732 is not affiliated with First, so any opions on the right way to run a team, and how to code, are purely the opions of Team 1732

Thank you for reading this far. Happy coding!
