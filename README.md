# Introduction

There are many good programming tutorials for Desktop Java, and the screen steps live tutorial does work for many of the basic functions for FRC Java. However, screen steps live, command based programming is introduced at the end, leading newer programmers to develop bad habits for working with a command based robot. As such, we have chosen to write our own tutorial, to cover everything from the basics of Command based programming, Git and Driver Control, to the advanced autos and control options available. The only requirement for taking this course is access to a computer, and a roborio for testing. No prior knowledge of Java is assumed.

If you are a Team 1732 freshman, you will have to bring your own computer, but we will be able to provide you with time to test and practice on a robot.

## This tutorial will teach the basics of FRC Java programming, along with command based programming.

Topics will include:

{% page-ref page="hello-world-example.md" %}

{% page-ref page="git-github.md" %}

{% page-ref page="driverstation.md" %}

{% page-ref page="subsytems.md" %}

{% page-ref page="motors.md" %}

{% page-ref page="commands.md" %}

{% page-ref page="joysticks.md" %}

{% page-ref page="drivetrain.md" %}

{% page-ref page="encoders.md" %}

{% page-ref page="gyros.md" %}

{% page-ref page="shuffleboard.md" %}

This book is not intended to teach basic Java concepts. However, the reality is that most poeple reading this tutorial will also be learning Java at the same time, so links refrences to videos in a free Udemy course will be provided for many of the Java concepts needed.

Thank you for reading this far. Happy coding!
