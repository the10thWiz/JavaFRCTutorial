# How to use this Tutorial

### Guide to the tutorial

This tutorial is written by the 2017-2018 programming subteam of FRC team 1732. Us, the authors, have worked with a robot for several years. Along the way, we have found the [https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/) website lacking in complete tutorials. While the screen steps provide small tidbits, we have spent years working how to put it all together.

For those who are not well versed in desktop Java, there is a free Udemy tutorial at [https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/learn/v4](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/learn/v4/). This tutorial was not created by Team 1732, but we have used this for a year now, and we think that it is a fantastic reasource to learn Java. However knowing Java is not a prerequisite to this tutorial. Instead, we have placed links to specific videos when you need to know the concepts.

### Symbols

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="filename.java:lineNumber" %}
```java
//Code looks like this
//this code is in 'filename.java', and starts on line 'lineNumber'
public class JavaTutorialClass {
    private final int zero = 0;
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Warnings will look like this. Warnings are simple tidbits and best practices
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Danger signs will be used in indicate items that could be extremely bad.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Simple hints on how to do some things better, or to note conventions will be placed in boxes like this.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Boxes like this will also provide advanced users with more complex and better methods. Udemy tutorials will be placed in boxes like this.
{% endhint %}

### Notes:

* This tutorial is written for the 2018 control system, however, we do plan to update this tutorial if possible.
* While this tutorial is written by and for Team 1732, other teams may find it useful. Be aware that some items are specific to Team 1732, but I will try to include a warning.
* Team 1732 is not affiliated with First, so any opinions on the right way to run a team, and how to code, are purely the opinions of Team 1732
* This tutorial was originaly written for the freshmen of Team 1732

### The Udemy Tutorial Notes:

Becuase no prior knowledge of Java is assumed, we will be using content from a Udemy tutorial to supplment this course with general Java knowledge. Becuase the Udemy course is intended to teach the entirety of Desktop Java, and FRC Java, we have notes in the various tutorials about when specific concepts are needed. For refrence, a list of the tutorials needed, by section, is provided below.
