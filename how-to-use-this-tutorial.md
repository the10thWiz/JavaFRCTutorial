# How to use this Tutorial

### Guide to the tutorial

This tutorial is written by the 2017-2018 programming subteam of FRC team 1732. Us, the authors, have worked with a robot for several years. Along the way, we have found the [https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/) website lacking in complete tutorials. While the screen steps provide small tidbits, we have spent years working how to put it all together.

For those who are not well versed in desktop Java, there is a free Udemy tutorial at [https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/learn/v4](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/learn/v4/). This tutorial was not created by Team 1732, but we have used this for a year now, and we think that it is a fantastic reasource to learn Java. However knowing Java is not a prerequisite to this tutorial. Instead, we have placed links to specific videos when you need to know the concepts.
