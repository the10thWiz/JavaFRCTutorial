# Git / Github

Git is collaboration software intended for programming. Github is a free public Git server, where you can host your own git repositories

Most FRC teams use Git and Github, including Team 1732

The tutorial here is for Github, ask your programming lead what your team uses.

### Clone a repository

To clone a repository in Eclipse, open the git panel. \(**WIndow **&gt;** Show view **&gt;** Other...** &gt; **Git Repositories**\)

From the git panel, click the clone button, and enter the clone url \(the green button on the upper right of the repository on github.com\).

Now the repository is on your computer, and it should show up in the Git Respositories view. If there are projects already in the repository, you can add them to the package explorer by right clicking the respository, and selecting import projects.

### Committing and Pushing

Once you have the repository on your computer, you can start editing it. Once you have made some changes, and want to share them back with the original repository, you need to commit and push them.

To do this, right click on the repository in the git view, and select **Commit**. In the view that pops up, all of the changes you have made show up on the top left. Move them to the bottom left by dragging them, and write a commit message on the right. Once you have chosen the changes to commit \(probably all of them\), select commit and push. This will save the changes you have made to a history that can be restored, and push them to Github. If you are not connected to a network, Commiting will still work, but you must wait until you are connected to the internet to push. Then, when you connect, right click on the repository, and select **Push**.

### Pulling

If someone else has made changes, and pushed them to github, you can pull them to your computer by right clicking the repostory, and selecting **Pull**.

### Merging



### Creating a repository

To create a Github repository, open up github.com, click the plus \(in the upper right\) and select **New Repository**. Give it a name, and click finish.
